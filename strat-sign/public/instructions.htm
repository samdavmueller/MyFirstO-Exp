    <h1>Instructions for the Signal Sharing Game</h1>
    <h3>Please, read them carefully!</h3>
    <div id="instructions">
      <br>
      This game is played by one human player and two automated player.
      <br><br>
      In each round, you and the automated players have to decide as a group whether an urn is blue or red.
      Both colors are equally likely.
      <br><br>
      In the beginning, each player receives between 0 and 3 private signals. This means, that no other player has the same signal.
      There is a <span id="getsignal"></span>% chance that a signal contains a color and with a chance of <span id="getnosignal"></span>% it is empty and not shown.<br>
      If a signal shows a color, there is a <span id="correctsignal"></span>% chance that the color shown is the same as that of the urn and a <span id="wrongsignal"></span>% chance that the color is different.<br>
      In the first part of the game you have to decide whether you want to share any single signal with the automated players or hide it from them.<br>
      The automated players always share all of their signals.
<br><br>
      Next, you see all the signals each player deciced to share and you have to make a voting decision that indicates your belief of the true color of the urn.<br>
      The automated players receive all signals that were shared too. Then they make their voting decion in the following way:<br>
        1. They count the number of shared signals that show 'red' and multiply it by <span id="bias"></span>.<br>
        2. Then they count the number of shared signals that show 'blue' and multiply if by <span id="bias2"></span>.<br>
        3. Finally, the automated players compare the numbers they received and vote for the color that has the larger number. If both number are the same, they decide for 'red'.
<br><br>
      In the end all the votes for 'blue' and 'red' are counted and the color with more votes is the group decision.
      If the decision has the same color as the true color of the urn, you earn 2 USD.
      <br><br>
      The game is repeated a certain number of rounds, and each round the color of the urn might change.
