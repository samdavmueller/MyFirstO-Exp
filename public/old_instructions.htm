    <h1>Instructions for the 'Guess the Urn'-Game</h1>
    <h3>Please read these instructions carefully!</h3>
    <div id="instructions">
      <br>
      In this game, you have to guess the color of an urn.
      <br><br>
      The urn can be  <span style="color:blue">blue</span> or
      <span style="color:red">red</span></strong>.
      Both colors are equally likely.
      You receive signals that can help you make your decision.
      All signals you receive contain a color, either
      <span style="color:red">red</span> or <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
      On average, six out of ten signals contain the same color as the urn they
      are describing, while four signals show a different color.
      For example, if the urn is <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, there is
      a <span id="correctsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>% chance that the
      signal you receive is <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
      and a <span id="wrongsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>% chance that
      it is <span style="color:red">red</span>.<br><br>
      <strong> You are paid when your decision matches the true color of
      the urn. </strong>

      <br><br>
      In the beginning, each player receives between
      <strong> 0 and 2 signals</strong>. No other player has the same signals or
      knows how many or which signals you received.<br>
      The exact probability of receiving 0, 1, or 2 signals is shown in the
      table below. <br><br>
      <table style="width:60%; margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">
        <tr>
          <th> Number of signals </th>
          <th> Probability </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 0 </td>
          <td> 1% </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 1 </td>
          <td> 18% </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 2 </td>
          <td> 81% </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
<br><br>

      In the first part of the game you have to decide whether you want to
      <strong>share a signal with the automated players or hide it from
      them</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>The automated players always share all of their signals.</strong>
<br><br>
      After your decision to share or hide your signal(s), you will <strong>see all
        shared signals</strong> (both, from you and the automated players) and you have to
        <strong>make a voting decision</strong> that indicates your belief about
        the true color of the urn.<br><br>
      The automated players will see all signals that were shared as well.
      <strong>They will then make their voting decision as follows:</strong><br>
        1. They count the <strong>number of shared signals that show
          '<span style="color:blue">blue</span>'</strong> and multiply it by
          <span id="bias2" style="font-weight:bold; color: blue"></span>.<br>
        2. Then they count the <strong>number of shared signals that show
          '<span style="color:red">red</span>'</strong> and multiply it by
          <span id="bias" style="font-weight:bold; color: red">x</span>, which is
          a number between 0 and 30.<br>
        3. Finally, the automated players compare the numbers they calculated and
        <strong>vote for the color that has the larger number</strong>.
        If both numbers are the <strong>same</strong>, a coin toss decides the
        color they choose.<br><br>
The automated players are identical and made the following choices after seeing the signals given below: <br><br>

      In the end all the votes for '<span style="color:blue">blue</span>' and
      '<span style="color:red">red</span>' are counted and the <strong>color
      with more votes is the group decision</strong>.<br>
      If the <strong>group decision</strong> on a color and the <strong>true color</strong> of
      the urn <strong>match</strong>, the possible payoff for the round is <strong>30 ECU</strong> (Experimental Currency).<br>
      Additional <strong>10 ECU</strong> are added to the payoff if <strong>your vote
      decision</strong> matched the color of the urn. 10 ECU are equal to
      $<span id="exchange-rate"></span>. Only two randomly chosen rounds are paid in US$ in the end.
      <br>
      <br>
      First you play <strong> three unpaid training rounds</strong>. <br>
      Then, the game is <strong>played over six rounds</strong>.</br>
      <strong>Only two rounds are randomly chosen and their payoffs are added to your final bonus</strong>.</br>
      <strong>Be aware that the color of the urn might change in each round</strong>.</br>
      <strong>The automated players and the <span style="font-weight:bold; color: red">x</span> stay the same through all rounds</strong>.
      <br><br>
      After the game you can earn <strong>more money by completing additional tasks</strong>.
