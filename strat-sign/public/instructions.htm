    <h1>Instructions for the Signal Sharing Game</h1>
    <h3>Please read them carefully</h3>
    <div id="instructions">
      <br>
      This game is played by one human player and two automated player.
      <br><br>
      In each round, you and the automated players have to decide whether an urn is blue or red.
      Both colors are equally likely.
      <br><br>
      In the beginning, each player receives between 0 and 3 signals (the probability to receive each of those three signals is 0.7).<br>
      Then you can decide whether you want to share any single signal with the automated players or hide it from them.<br>
      The signals show the true color of the urn with a probability of 0.7 and the wrong color with a probability of 0.3.<br>
      The automated players always share all of their signals.
<br><br>
      Next, you receive all the signals each player deciced to share and you have to make a voting decision that indicates your belief of the true color of the urn.<br>
      The automated players make their voting decion in the following way:<br>
        1. They count the number of shared signals that show 'red' and multiply it by <span id="bias"></span>.<br>
        2. Then they count the number of shared signals that show 'blue' and multiply if by <span id="bias2"></span>.<br>
        3. Finally, the automated players compare the numbers they received and vote for the color that has the larger number.
<br><br>
      In the end all the votes for 'blue' and 'red' are counted and the color with more votes is the group decision.
      If the decision has the same color as the true color of the urn, you earn 2 USD.
      <br><br>
      The game is repeated a certain number of rounds, and each round the color of the urn might change.
