    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>
  We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based
  online experiment. The experiment is part of a research
  program investigating decision making
  in groups.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>You must be at least 18 years old to participate
    in these experiments.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The decision to participate in this research
    project is voluntary.</strong> You do not have to
  participate and you can refuse to answer any
  question. Even if you begin the web-based experiment, you
  can stop at any time by closing your browser.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to you
    for taking part in this study.</strong> We anticipate that
  it will take about
  <em><span id="time"></span> minutes</em> to complete this
  task. You will only be rewarded for completing
  the task, not for the length of time you participate.
</p>

<p>
  You will be compensated for good faith participation in this
  experiment with <em>at least $<span id="low_money"></span>
    and an additional bonus between $0 and $<span id="high_money"></span></em>.
  The exact amount of your payoff depends both on your decisions and on chance.
  Submitted HITs will be <strong>rejected</strong>
  if they are completed in a manner that appears to be random,
  incomplete, or otherwise negligent.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Your part in this study is anonymized for the
    researchers.</strong> Researchers at the University of Mannheim, Germany
    may have access to anonymized experimental research
    records. However, because of the nature of electronic
    systems, it is possible that respondents could be
    identified by some electronic record associated with the
    response. Neither the researcher nor anyone involved with
    this study will be capturing those data. Any reports or
    publications based on this research will use only group
    data and will not identify you or any individual as being
    affiliated with this project. The only
    individually-identifying data we receive from Mechanical
    Turk are your unique identifier and your country.  Your
    data are also stored on Mechanical Turk's servers, and the
    data there are subject to the Amazon Mechanical Turk
    Privacy Notice and Participation Agreement.
