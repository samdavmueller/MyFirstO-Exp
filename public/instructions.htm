      <br>
      In this task, you have to guess the color of an urn.
      The urn can be  <span style="color:blue">blue</span> or
      <span style="color:red">red</span></strong>.
      Both colors are equally likely.
      <br>
      In each urn there are 100 balls. In the <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
      urn there are <span id="correctsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>
      <span style="color:blue">blue</span> balls and <span id="wrongsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>
      <span style="color:red">red</span> balls. While in the <span style="color:red">red</span>
      urn there are <span id="correctsignal2" style="font-weight:bold"></span>
      <span style="color:red">red</span> balls and
      <span id="wrongsignal2" style="font-weight:bold"></span> <span style="color:blue">blue</span> balls.
      <br>
      To help you guess the correct color of the urn, one ball is randomly drawn out of the urn,
      the color shown to you and then ball is returned to the urn. This procedure is possibly
      repeated several times. Your hint might then look for example as follows:<br>
      <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, <span style="color:red">red</span>
      <br>
      In this task you have to guess which color the urn probably has.
      <br>
      <strong> You are paid when all your different guesses match the most likely color of
      the different urns. </strong>
      <br>
      During the game we use an Experimental Currency (ECU).
      10 ECU are equal to $<span id="exchange-rate"></span>. If you guess
      the color of all urns correctly, you receive 30 ECU.
      <br>
      You receive information about
      your performance and bonus payment in the end of the game.
