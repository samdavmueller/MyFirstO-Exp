## A Game about strategic information revelation with biased committee members
This experiment is designed to uncover the strategic information sharing of individuals in a committee situation when faced with biased information updating. Formal theory showed that in a committee with rational agents complete information revelation is possible if and only if some "closeness condition" is fulfilled concerning the individual theresholds of reasonable doubt of committee members. In other words, whenever these thresholds are spread further apart and known, it is not rational for committee members to reveal their signal truthfully (or at all) (Coughlan 2000, Schulte 2010). In an extension of the model by Schulte (2010) I show that the existence of complete correlation neglect for some agents reduces the existence of full information revelation equilibrium to a situation in which rational individuals and those neglecting correlation end up with identical beliefs, meaning correlation neglect is not biasing the posterior belief of those individuals. 

This result shows that whenever individuals who have to make a common decision face a situation in which the same prior information and the same signals lead to different posterior beliefs, a pivotal voter has an incentive to share signals strategically. Strategic signal sharing can either mean lying about the direction of their signal or hiding a signal that was received. While theoretic models can show how perfectly rational actors would "in equilibrium" act whenever they face a situation in which individuals update their information in a non rational way, there is no conclusive evidence about human behavior in these situations. This experiment is meant to create such evidence by placing humans in a committee decision with bots that perform biased upadting. Humans can affect bots behavior by their information sharing behavior prior to some voting stage. The results show us to which degree humans actually understand in an oversimplified setting how their information sharing behavior might affect group decision making.
