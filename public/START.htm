      <br>
      In this game, you have to guess the color of an urn together
       with two automated players in a group.
      <br><br>
      Just like in the previous game, the urn can be  <span style="color:blue">blue</span> or
      <span style="color:red">red</span></strong>.
      Both colors are equally likely.
      You receive signals that can help you make your decision.
      All signals you receive contain a color, either
      <span style="color:red">red</span> or <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
      On average, six out of ten signals contain the same color as the urn they
      are describing, while four signals show a different color.

      This time, the game consists of two stages:

      <br><br>
      In the beginning, each player receives between
      <strong> 0 and 2 signals</strong>. No other player has the same signals or
      knows how many or which signals you received.<br>
      In the first part of the game you have to decide whether you want to
      <strong>share a signal with the automated players or hide it from
      them</strong>. If you <strong> share </strong> the signal, the automated
      players take it into account when making their decision. If you <strong>hide</strong> the
      signal, the automated players cannot take your signals into account when making their vote choice.<br><br>

      The exact probability of receiving 0, 1, or 2 signals is shown in the
      table below. <br><br>
      <table style="width:60%; margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">
        <tr>
          <th> Number of signals </th>
          <th> Probability </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 0 </td>
          <td> 1% </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 1 </td>
          <td> 18% </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 2 </td>
          <td> 81% </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
<br><br>

      <strong>The automated players always share all of the signals they receive.</strong>
<br><br>


      After your decision to share or hide your signal(s), you will <strong>see all
        shared signals</strong> (both, from you and the automated players) and you have to
        <strong>make a voting decision</strong> on the color of the urn.<br><br>
      The automated players will see all signals that were shared as well.
      <strong>They always both make the same voting decision.</strong><br>

You have information about the players previous decisions for the six urns you have faced in the previous game: <br><br>

<br><h4><i>During the game you can use the yellow button above to re-read the
  information about the automated players' behavior.</i></h4><br>

      In the end all the votes for '<span style="color:blue">blue</span>' and
      '<span style="color:red">red</span>' are counted and the <strong>color
      with more votes is the group decision</strong>.<br>
      If the <strong>group decision</strong> and the <strong>true color</strong> of
      the urn <strong>match</strong>, the possible payoff for the round is <strong>30 ECU</strong> (Experimental Currency).<br>
      Remember, 10 ECU are equal to $<span id="exchange-rate"></span>.
      <br>
      <br>
      The game is <strong>played over six rounds</strong>. Only two randomly chosen rounds of these six are paid in US$ in the end.
      </br>
      Be aware that <strong>the color of the urn might change in each round</strong> as you face different urns.</br>
      The automated players and their <strong>vote decision with respect to signal realizations stay the same through all rounds</strong>.
      <br><br>
      After the game you can earn <strong>more money by completing additional tasks</strong>.
