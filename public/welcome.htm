    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>
  We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based
  online experiment. The experiment is part of a research
  program investigating decision making
  in groups.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>You must be at least 18 years old to participate
    in these experiments.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The decision to participate in this experiment
  is voluntary.</strong> Even after the start of the web-based experiment, you
  can stop at any time by closing your browser.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to you
    for taking part in this study.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You will be compensated for good faith participation in this
  experiment with <em>at least $<span id="low_money"></span></em>
    and an additional bonus between $0 and $<span id="high_money"></span>.
    <em>We expect that you urn on average an additional bonus of
      $<span id="middle_money"></span></em>.
  The exact amount of your payoff depends both on your decisions and on chance.
  We anticipate that it will take about
  <em><span id="time"></span> minutes</em> to complete this
  task. You will be rewarded for completing
  the task, not for the length of time you participate.
  Submitted HITs will be <strong>rejected</strong>
  if they are completed in a manner that appears to be random,
  incomplete, or otherwise negligent.
