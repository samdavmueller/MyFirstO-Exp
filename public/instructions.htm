    <h1>Instructions for the 'Guess the Urn'-Game</h1>
    <h3>Please read these instructions carefully!</h3>
    <div id="instructions">
      <br>
      This game is played by one human player and two automated players.
      <br><br>
      In each round, you and the automated players have to <strong>decide as a
      group whether an urn is <span style="color:blue">blue</span> or
      <span style="color:red">red</span></strong>.
      <strong> You are paid when your group decision matches the true color of
      the urn. </strong>
      Both colors are equally likely.
      <br><br>
      In the beginning, each player receives between
      <strong> 0 and 3 signals</strong>. No other player has the same signals or
      knows how many or which signals you received.<br>
      The exact probability of receiving 0, 1, 2 or 3 signals is shown in the
      table below. <br><br>
      <table style="width:60%; margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">
        <tr>
          <th> Number of signals </th>
          <th> Probability </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 0 </td>
          <td> 3% </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 1 </td>
          <td> 19% </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 2 </td>
          <td> 44% </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 3 </td>
          <td> 34% </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
<br><br>
      All signals you receive contain a color, either
      <span style="color:red">red</span> or <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
      On average, six out of ten signals contain the same color as the urn they
      are describing, while four signals show a different color.
      For example, if the urn is <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, there is
      a <span id="correctsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>% chance that the
      signal you receive is <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
      and a <span id="wrongsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>% chance that
      it is <span style="color:red">red</span>.<br><br>
      In the first part of the game you have to decide whether you want to
      <strong>share an signal with the automated players or hide it from
      them</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>The automated players always share all of their signals.</strong>
<br><br>
      After your decision to share or hide your signal(s), you will <strong>see all
        shared signals</strong> (both, from you and the automated players) and you have to
        <strong>make a voting decision</strong> that indicates your belief about
        the true color of the urn.<br><br>
      The automated players will see all signals that were shared as well.
      <strong>They will then make their voting decision as follows:</strong><br>
        1. They count the <strong>number of shared signals that show
          '<span style="color:red">red</span>'</strong> and multiply it by
          <span id="bias" style="font-weight:bold; color: red"></span>.<br>
        2. Then they count the <strong>number of shared signals that show
          '<span style="color:blue">blue</span>'</strong> and multiply it by
          <span id="bias2" style="font-weight:bold; color: blue"></span>.<br>
        3. Finally, the automated players compare the numbers they calculated and
        <strong>vote for the color that has the larger number</strong>.
        If both number are the <strong>same</strong>, a coin toss decides the
        color they choose.<br><br>

        <strong>For example</strong>, if the shared signals are <span style="color:red">red</span>,
        <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, <span style="color:red">red</span>,
        <span style="color:red">red</span>, <span style="color:blue">blue</span>,
        <span style="color:red">red</span> and <span style="color:blue">blue</span>,
        the number of signals would be <span style="color:red">4 red</span> and
        <span style="color:blue">3 blue</span> signals.<br>
        The automated players calculate: <br>
        <span style="color:red">4 red</span> &times
        <span id="bias3" style="color: red"></span> =
        <span id="red_count" style="font-weight:bold; color: red"></span><br>
        <span style="color:blue">3 blue</span> &times
        <span id="bias4" style="color: blue"></span> =
        <span id="blue_count" style="font-weight:bold; color: blue"></span><br>
        Accordingly, the automated players vote for <span style="color:red">red</span>.


<br><h4><i>During the game you can use the yellow button above to re-read the
  information about the automated players' behavior.</i></h4><br>

      In the end all the votes for '<span style="color:blue">blue</span>' and
      '<span style="color:red">red</span>' are counted and the <strong>color
      with more votes is the group decision</strong>.<br>
      If the <strong>group decision</strong> on a color and the <strong>true color</strong> of
      the urn <strong>match</strong>, you earn <strong>30 ECU</strong> (Experimental Currency).<br>
      You can earn additional <strong>10 ECU</strong> if <strong>your vote
      decision</strong> matched the color of the urn. 10 ECU are equal to
      $<span id="exchange-rate"></span>.
      <br>
      <br>
      First you play <strong> three unpaid training rounds</strong>. <br>
      Then, the game is <strong>played over three rounds and earnings are added to
      your final payoff</strong>.</br>
      <strong>Be aware that the color of the urn might change in each round</strong>.
      <br><br>
      After the game you can earn <strong>more money by completing additional tasks</strong>.
      Filling out the final questionnaire gives you an additional payment of
      <strong>20 ECU ($0.34)</strong>.
