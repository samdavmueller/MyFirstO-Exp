    <h1>Instructions for the 'Guess the Urn'-Game</h1>
    <h3>Please read these instructions carefully!</h3>

      <br>
      In this game, you have to guess the color of an urn.
      <br><br>
      There are two versions of this game. In the first version you guess on your own
      which color different urns have. In the second, you guess the color of the urn
      together with a group of two other players by voting. You receive information about
      your performance and bonus payment in the end of the game.
      <br><br>
      <h3>Single-Player version of 'Guess the Urn'</h3>
      The urn can be  <span style="color:blue">blue</span> or
      <span style="color:red">red</span></strong>.
      Both colors are equally likely.
      You receive signals that can help you make your decision.
      All signals you receive contain a color, either
      <span style="color:red">red</span> or <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
      On average, six out of ten signals contain the same color as the urn they
      are describing, while four signals show a different color.
      For example, if the urn is <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, there is
      a <span id="correctsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>% chance that the
      signal you receive is <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
      and a <span id="wrongsignal" style="font-weight:bold"></span>% chance that
      it is <span style="color:red">red</span>.<br><br>
      <strong> You are paid when all your decisions match the true color of
      the different urns. </strong> During the game we use an Experimental Currency (ECU).
      10 ECU are equal to $<span id="exchange-rate"></span>. If you guess
      the color of all urns correctly, you receive 30 ECU.

    If you understand the instructions press the 'Done' button to
    proceed to single player game of 'Guess the Urn'.
